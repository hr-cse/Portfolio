Pointer:[A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable.]
	-call by value
	-call by reference

Vector:[Vectors are same as dynamic arrays with the ability to resize itself automatically when an element is inserted or deleted, with their storage being handled automatically by the container.]
	



Advantages of OOP programming:
	-MAINTAINABILITY 
	-REUSABILITY 
	-SCALABILITY 

Class:[default constructor, parameterized constructor, destructor]
Constructor Public
	-private member/variable
	-public member/variable
	-protected member/variable

Inheritance:
	-super class 
	-sub class
	-single inheritance 
	-multilevel inheritance
	-multiple inheritance

Friend Function:
	-If a function is defined as a friend function then, the private and protected data of a class can be accessed using the function.

Polymorphism:[function name same aurgument vinno]
	-function overloading
	-operator overloading [baki]
	-virtual function: same function base class & dirive class e thakle. 
	-Pure Virtual Functions: the function has no body and above virtual function will be called pure virtual function.

Interface:
	-An interface describes the behavior or capabilities of a C++ class without committing to a particular implementation of that class.

Template:
	-In simple terms, you can create a single function or a class to work with different data types using templates.
